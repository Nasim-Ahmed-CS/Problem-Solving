To find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the median of the array.
2. For each element in the array, calculate the absolute difference between the element and the median, and sum up these differences.
3. The sum obtained in step 2 will be the minimum number of moves required.

***The mathematical truth behind using the median to minimize the total distance each element needs to move to reach a common value lies in the concept of optimization and the properties of the median itself.***

To understand this, let's delve into some mathematical reasoning:

**Definition of the Median**: The median of a dataset is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.
Minimization of Absolute Deviations: Given a set of numbers, the absolute deviation of each number from a chosen value (in this case, the median) is the absolute difference between the number and the chosen value. When we aim to minimize the total distance each element needs to move to reach a common value, we are essentially minimizing the sum of these absolute deviations.<br>
**Optimization**: To minimize the sum of absolute deviations, we need to find a value that balances the distances of all elements from it. The median naturally serves this purpose because it is the value that minimizes the sum of absolute deviations from itself. This is a known property of the median in statistics and optimization theory.<br>
**Proof**: The proof that the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations involves calculus and optimization techniques. It can be shown that for any given set of numbers, the value that minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations is the median. This can be formally demonstrated using mathematical proofs and optimization algorithms.
