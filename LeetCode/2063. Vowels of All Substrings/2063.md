Use exclusion criteria.
First, calculate the answer assuming all letters in the string vowels. The answer is the summation of $\frac{i * (i + 1)}{2}$ for all i from 1 to n.
Let, the summation be $ans$
Then, we will remove the substrings with the occurrence of non-vowels. This can be calculated by calculating a simple formula $k = ((n - i) * (i + 1))$ if $word_i$ is not a vowel
